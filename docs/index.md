# Wearable Data Processing

This repository contains Python pipelines for processing wearable sensor data across three domains:
- **Sleep**
- **Heart Rate**
- **Physical Activity**

# Wearable Data Processing

This package provides tools for processing wearable sensor data across multiple domains:
- **Sleep**: Extract sleep-related features from accelerometer data.
- **Heart Rate**: Compute HR, HRV, and related metrics.
- **Physical Activity**: Extract metrics of physical activity and mobility (e.g., gait).
